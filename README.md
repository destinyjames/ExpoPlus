Description

ExpoPlus is designed to enhance the attendee experience at expo events by replacing the traditional booklet with a dynamic, user-friendly web application. It allows attendees to input their interests in programs, areas, and technologies, offering tailored project recommendations. Additionally, our application features an interactive map for easy navigation highlighting the projects the attendees wish to visit. 

Users can also rate projects upon visit and will then be switched to a more enhanced recommendation system where projects that similar users have rated highly will be recommended to the user.
Users can also browse freely and search for particular projects.
